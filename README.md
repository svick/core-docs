# .NET Docs

This repository contains the conceptual documentation for .NET. The [.NET documentation site](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet) is built from multiple repositories in addition to this one:

- [Code samples and snippets](https://github.com/dotnet/samples)
- [API reference](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-api-docs)
- [.NET Compiler Platform SDK reference](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-api-docs)

Issues and tasks for all three of those repositories are tracked here. We have a large community using these resources. We make our best effort to respond to issues in a timely fashion. You can read more about our procedures for classifying and resolving issues in our [Issues policy](issues-policy.md) topic.

We welcome contributions to help us improve and complete the .NET docs. To contribute, see the [Projects for .NET Community Contributors](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/projects/35) for ideas. The [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) has instructions on procedures we use. Or, check the [issues list](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/issues) for tasks that interest you.

We anticipate that [Xamarin](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin), [Mono](http://docs.go-mono.com/?link=root%3a%2fclasslib) and [Unity](http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html) will also use this documentation.

This project has adopted the code of conduct defined by the Contributor Covenant
