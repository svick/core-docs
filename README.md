# .NET Docs

This repository contains the conceptual documentation for .NET. The [.NET documentation site](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet) is built from multiple repositories in addition to this one:

- [Code samples and snippets](https://github.com/dotnet/samples)
- [API reference](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-api-docs)
- [.NET Compiler Platform SDK reference](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-api-docs)

Issues and tasks for all three of those repositories are tracked here.

We welcome contributions to help us improve and complete the .NET docs. To contribute, see the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [issues list](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/issues).

We anticipate that [Xamarin](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin), [Mono](http://docs.go-mono.com/?link=root%3a%2fclasslib) and [Unity](http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html) will also use this documentation.
