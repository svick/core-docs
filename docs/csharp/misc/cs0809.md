# Compiler Warning (level 1) CS0809
Obsolete member 'memberA' overrides non-obsolete member 'memberB'.  
  
 Typically, a member that is marked as obsolete should not override a member that is not marked as obsolete. This warning is generated in [!INCLUDE[vs_orcas_long](~/includes/vs-orcas-long-md.md)] but not in [!INCLUDE[vsprvslong](~/includes/vsprvslong-md.md)].  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Remove the `Obsolete` attribute from the overriding member, or add it to the base class member.  
  
## Example  
  
```csharp  
// CS0809.cs  
public class Base  
{  
    public virtual void Test1()  
    {  
    }  
}  
public class C : Base  
{  
    [System.Obsolete()]  
    public override void Test1() // CS0809  
    {  
    }  
}  
```
