# Compiler Error CS1955
Non-invocable member 'name' cannot be used like a method.  
  
 Only methods and delegates can be invoked. This error is generated when you try to use empty parentheses to call something other than a method or delegate.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Remove the parentheses from the expression.  
  
## Example  
 The following code generates CS1955 because the code is trying to invoke a field and a property by using the method call operator [()](../../csharp/language-reference/operators/invocation-operator.md). You cannot call a field or property, but you can access the value it stores by using the member access operator ( [.](../../csharp/language-reference/operators/member-access-operator.md) ).  
  
```csharp  
// cs1955.cs  
class A  
{  
    public int x = 0;  
    public int X  
    {  
        get { return x; }  
        set { x = value; }  
    }  
}  
  
class Test  
{  
    static int Main()  
    {  
        A a = new A();  
        a.x(); // CS1955  
        a.X(); // CS1955  
        // Try this line instead:  
        // int num = a.x;  
    }  
}  
```
