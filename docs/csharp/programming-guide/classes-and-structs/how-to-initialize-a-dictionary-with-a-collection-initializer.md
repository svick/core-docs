# How to: Initialize a Dictionary with a Collection Initializer (C# Programming Guide)
A <xref:System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2> contains a collection of key/value pairs. Its <xref:System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2.Add*> method takes two parameters, one for the key and one for the value. To initialize a <xref:System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2>, or any collection whose `Add` method takes multiple parameters, enclose each set of parameters in braces as shown in the following example.  
  
## Example  
 In the following code example, a <xref:System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2> is initialized with instances of type `StudentName`.  
  
 [!code-csharp[csProgGuideLINQ#34](../../../csharp/programming-guide/arrays/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-initialize-a-dictionary-with-a-collection-initializer_1.cs)]  
  
 Note the two pairs of braces in each element of the collection. The innermost braces enclose the object initializer for the `StudentName`, and the outermost braces enclose the initializer for the key/value pair that will be added to the `students`<xref:System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2>. Finally, the whole collection initializer for the dictionary is enclosed in braces.  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 To run this code, copy and paste the class into a Visual C# console application project that has been created in Visual Studio. By default, this project targets version 3.5 of the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)], and it has a reference to System.Core.dll and a using directive for System.Linq. If one or more of these requirements are missing from the project, you can add them manually.
