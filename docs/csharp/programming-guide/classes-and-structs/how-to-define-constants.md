# How to: Define Constants in C#
Constants are fields whose values are set at compile time and can never be changed. Use constants to provide meaningful names instead of numeric literals ("magic numbers") for special values.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  In C# the [#define](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-define.md) preprocessor directive cannot be used to define constants in the way that is typically used in C and C++.  
  
 To define constant values of integral types (`int`, `byte`, and so on) use an enumerated type. For more information, see [enum](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/enum.md).  
  
 To define non-integral constants, one approach is to group them in a single static class named `Constants`. This will require that all references to the constants be prefaced with the class name, as shown in the following example.  
  
## Example  
 [!code-csharp[csProgGuideObjects#89](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-define-constants_1.cs)]  
  
 The use of the class name qualifier helps ensure that you and others who use the constant understand that it is constant and cannot be modified.
