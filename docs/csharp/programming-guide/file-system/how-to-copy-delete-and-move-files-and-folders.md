# How to: Copy, Delete, and Move Files and Folders (C# Programming Guide)
The following examples show how to copy, move, and delete files and folders in a synchronous manner by using the <xref:System.IO.File?displayProperty=nameWithType>, <xref:System.IO.Directory?displayProperty=nameWithType>, <xref:System.IO.FileInfo?displayProperty=nameWithType>, and <xref:System.IO.DirectoryInfo?displayProperty=nameWithType> classes from the <xref:System.IO?displayProperty=nameWithType> namespace. These examples do not provide a progress bar or any other user interface. If you want to provide a standard progress dialog box, see [How to: Provide a Progress Dialog Box for File Operations](how-to-provide-a-progress-dialog-box-for-file-operations.md).  
  
 Use <xref:System.IO.FileSystemWatcher?displayProperty=nameWithType> to provide events that will enable you to calculate the progress when operating on multiple files. Another approach is to use platform invoke to call the relevant file-related methods in the Windows Shell. For information about how to perform these file operations asynchronously, see [Asynchronous File I/O](../../../standard/io/asynchronous-file-i-o.md).
