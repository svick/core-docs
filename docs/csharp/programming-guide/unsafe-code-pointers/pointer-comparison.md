# Pointer Comparison (C# Programming Guide)
You can apply the following operators to compare pointers of any type:  
  
 **==   !=   \<   >   \<=   >=**  
  
 The comparison operators compare the addresses of the two operands as if they are unsigned integers.  
  
## Example  
 [!code-csharp[csProgGuidePointers#16](../../../csharp/programming-guide/unsafe-code-pointers/codesnippet/CSharp/pointer-comparison_1.cs)]  
  
 [!code-csharp[csProgGuidePointers#17](../../../csharp/programming-guide/unsafe-code-pointers/codesnippet/CSharp/pointer-comparison_2.cs)]  
  
## Sample Output  
 `True`  
  
 `False`
