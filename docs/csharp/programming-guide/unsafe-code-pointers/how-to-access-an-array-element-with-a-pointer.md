# How to access an array element with a pointer (C# Programming Guide)

In an unsafe context, you can access an element in memory by using pointer element access, as shown in the following example:

```csharp
char* charPointer = stackalloc char[123];
for (int i = 65; i < 123; i++)
{
    charPointer[i] = (char)i; //access array elements
}
```

The expression in square brackets must be implicitly convertible to `int`, `uint`, `long`, or `ulong`. The operation p[e] is equivalent to \*(p+e). Like C and C++, the pointer element access does not check for out-of-bounds errors.

## Example

In this example, 123 memory locations are allocated to a character array, `charPointer`. The array is used to display the lowercase letters and the uppercase letters in two [for](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/for.md) loops.

Notice that the expression `charPointer[i]` is equivalent to the expression `*(charPointer + i)`, and you can obtain the same result by using either of the two expressions.

**Uppercase letters:**
**ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ**
**Lowercase letters:**
**abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz**
