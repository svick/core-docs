# Implicitly Typed Arrays (C# Programming Guide)

You can create an implicitly-typed array in which the type of the array instance is inferred from the elements specified in the array initializer. The rules for any implicitly-typed variable also apply to implicitly-typed arrays. For more information, see [Implicitly Typed Local Variables](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/implicitly-typed-local-variables.md).  
  
 Implicitly-typed arrays are usually used in query expressions together with anonymous types and object and collection initializers.  
  
 The following examples show how to create an implicitly-typed array:  
  
 [!code-csharp[csProgGuideLINQ#37](../../../csharp/programming-guide/arrays/codesnippet/CSharp/implicitly-typed-arrays_1.cs)]  
  
 In the previous example, notice that with implicitly-typed arrays, no square brackets are used on the left side of the initialization statement. Note also that jagged arrays are initialized by using `new []` just like single-dimension arrays.  
  
## Implicitly-typed Arrays in Object Initializers

 When you create an anonymous type that contains an array, the array must be implicitly typed in the type's object initializer. In the following example, `contacts` is an implicitly-typed array of anonymous types, each of which contains an array named `PhoneNumbers`. Note that the `var` keyword is not used inside the object initializers.
