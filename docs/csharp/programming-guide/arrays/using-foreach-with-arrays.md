# Using foreach with Arrays (C# Programming Guide)

The [foreach](../../language-reference/keywords/foreach-in.md) statement provides a simple, clean way to iterate through the elements of an array.

For single-dimensional arrays, the `foreach` statement processes elements in increasing index order, starting with index 0 and ending with index `Length - 1`:

[!code-csharp[csProgGuideArrays#28](./codesnippet/CSharp/using-foreach-with-arrays_1.cs)]

For multi-dimensional arrays, elements are traversed such that the indices of the rightmost dimension are increased first, then the next left dimension, and so on to the left:

[!code-csharp[csProgGuideArrays#29](./codesnippet/CSharp/using-foreach-with-arrays_2.cs)]

However, with multidimensional arrays, using a nested [for](../../language-reference/keywords/for.md) loop gives you more control over the order in which to process the array elements.
