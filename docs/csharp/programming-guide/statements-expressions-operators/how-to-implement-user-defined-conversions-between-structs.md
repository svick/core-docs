# How to: Implement User-Defined Conversions Between Structs (C# Programming Guide)
This example defines two structs, `RomanNumeral` and `BinaryNumeral`, and demonstrates conversions between them.  
  
## Example  
 [!code-csharp[csProgGuideStatements#13](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-implement-user-defined-conversions-between-structs_1.cs)]  
  
## Robust Programming  
  
-   In the previous example, the statement:  
  
     [!code-csharp[csProgGuideStatements#14](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-implement-user-defined-conversions-between-structs_2.cs)]  
  
     performs a conversion from a `RomanNumeral` to a `BinaryNumeral`. Because there is no direct conversion from `RomanNumeral` to `BinaryNumeral`, a cast is used to convert from a `RomanNumeral` to an `int`, and another cast to convert from an `int` to a `BinaryNumeral`.  
  
-   Also the statement  
  
     [!code-csharp[csProgGuideStatements#15](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-implement-user-defined-conversions-between-structs_3.cs)]  
  
     performs a conversion from a `BinaryNumeral` to a `RomanNumeral`. Because `RomanNumeral` defines an implicit conversion from `BinaryNumeral`, no cast is required.
