# How to: Use Operator Overloading to Create a Complex Number Class (C# Programming Guide)
This example shows how you can use operator overloading to create a complex number class `Complex` that defines complex addition. The program displays the imaginary and the real parts of the numbers and the addition result using an override of the `ToString` method.
