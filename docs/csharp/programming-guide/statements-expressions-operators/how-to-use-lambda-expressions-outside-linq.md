# How to: Use Lambda Expressions Outside LINQ (C# Programming Guide)
Lambda expressions are not limited to [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](~/includes/vbteclinq-md.md)] queries. You can use them anywhere a delegate value is expected, that is, wherever an anonymous method can be used. The following example shows how to use a lambda expression in a Windows Forms event handler. Notice that the types of the inputs (<xref:System.Object> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MouseEventArgs>) are inferred by the compiler and do not have to be explicitly given in the lambda input parameters.  
  
## Example  
  
```csharp  
public partial class Form1 : Form  
{  
    public Form1()  
    {  
        InitializeComponent();  
        // Use a lambda expression to define an event handler.  
       this.Click += (s, e) => { MessageBox.Show(((MouseEventArgs)e).Location.ToString());};  
    }  
}  
```
