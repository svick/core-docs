# Introduction to Generics (C# Programming Guide)
Generic classes and methods combine reusability, type safety and efficiency in a way that their non-generic counterparts cannot. Generics are most frequently used with collections and the methods that operate on them. Version 2.0 of the .NET Framework class library provides a new namespace, <xref:System.Collections.Generic>, which contains several new generic-based collection classes. It is recommended that all applications that target the .NET Framework 2.0 and later use the new generic collection classes instead of the older non-generic counterparts such as <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList>. For more information, see [Generics in .NET](../../../standard/generics/index.md).  
  
 Of course, you can also create custom generic types and methods to provide your own generalized solutions and design patterns that are type-safe and efficient. The following code example shows a simple generic linked-list class for demonstration purposes. (In most cases, you should use the <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601> class provided by the .NET Framework class library instead of creating your own.) The type parameter `T` is used in several locations where a concrete type would ordinarily be used to indicate the type of the item stored in the list. It is used in the following ways:  
  
-   As the type of a method parameter in the `AddHead` method.  
  
-   As the return type of the `Data` property in the nested `Node` class.  
  
-   As the type of the private member `data` in the nested class.  
  
 Note that T is available to the nested `Node` class. When `GenericList<T>` is instantiated with a concrete type, for example as a `GenericList<int>`, each occurrence of `T` will be replaced with `int`.

 The following code example shows how client code uses the generic `GenericList<T>` class to create a list of integers. Simply by changing the type argument, the following code could easily be modified to create lists of strings or any other custom type:
