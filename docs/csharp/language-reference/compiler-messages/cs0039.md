# Compiler Error CS0039
Cannot convert type 'type1' to 'type2' via a reference conversion, boxing conversion, unboxing conversion, wrapping conversion, or null type conversion  
  
 A conversion with the [as](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/as.md) operator is allowed by inheritance, reference conversions, and boxing conversions. For more information, see [Conversion Operators](../../../csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/conversion-operators.md).  
  
## Example  
 The following example generates CS0039.  
  
```csharp  
// CS0039.cs  
using System;  
class A  
{  
}  
class B: A  
{  
}  
class C: A  
{  
}  
class M  
{  
    static void Main()  
    {  
        A a = new C();  
        B b = new B();  
        C c;  
  
        // This is valid; there is a built-in reference  
        // conversion from A to C.  
        c = a as C;    
  
        //The following generates CS0039; there is no  
        // built-in reference conversion from B to C.  
        c = b as C;  // CS0039  
    }  
}  
```
