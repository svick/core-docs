# #endif (C# Reference)
`#endif` specifies the end of a conditional directive, which began with the [#if](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-if.md) directive. For example,  
  
```csharp
#define DEBUG  
// ...  
#if DEBUG  
    Console.WriteLine("Debug version");  
#endif  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 A conditional directive, beginning with a `#if` directive, must explicitly be terminated with a `#endif` directive. See [#if](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-if.md) for an example of how to use `#endif`.
