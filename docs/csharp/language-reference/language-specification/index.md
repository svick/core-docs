# C# 6.0 draft language specification

The C# language specification is the definitive source for C# syntax and usage. This specification contains detailed information about all aspects of the language, including many points that the documentation for C# doesn't cover.

Version 5.0 of the specification has been released in December 2017 as the [Standard ECMA-334 5th Edition](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-334.pdf) document.

Version 6.0 of the specification has not been approved as a standard. This site contains the [*draft* C# 6.0 specification](../../../../_csharplang/spec/introduction.md). It's built from the markdown files contained in the [dotnet/csharplang GitHub repository](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/spec/README.md).

Issues on the draft specification should be created in the [dotnet/csharplang](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues) repository. Or, if you are interested
in fixing any errors you find, you may submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/pulls) to the same repository.
