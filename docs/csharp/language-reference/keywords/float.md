# float (C# Reference)

The `float` keyword signifies a simple type that stores 32-bit floating-point values. The following table shows the precision and approximate range for the `float` type.

|Type|Approximate range|Precision|.NET type|  
|----------|-----------------------|---------------|-------------------------|  
|`float`|±1.5 x 10<sup>−45</sup> to ±3.4 x 10<sup>38</sup>|~6-9 digits|<xref:System.Single?displayProperty=nameWithType>|  

## Literals

By default, a real numeric literal on the right side of the assignment operator is treated as [double](double.md). Therefore, to initialize a float variable, use the suffix `f` or `F`, as in the following example:

```csharp
float x = 3.5F;
```

If you do not use the suffix in the previous declaration, you will get a compilation error because you are trying to store a [double](double.md) value into a `float` variable.

## Conversions

You can mix numeric integral types and floating-point types in an expression. In this case, the integral types are converted to floating-point types. The evaluation of the expression is performed according to the following rules:

- If one of the floating-point types is [double](double.md), the expression evaluates to [double](double.md), or to [bool](bool.md) in relational comparisons or comparisons for equality.

- If there is no [double](double.md) type in the expression, the expression evaluates to `float`, or to [bool](bool.md) in relational comparisons or comparisons for equality.

A floating-point expression can contain the following sets of values:

- Positive and negative zero

- Positive and negative infinity

- Not-a-Number value (NaN)

- The finite set of nonzero values

For more information about these values, see IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic, available on the [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org) website.

## Example

In the following example, an [int](int.md), a [short](short.md), and a `float` are included in a mathematical expression giving a `float` result. (Remember that `float` is an alias for the <xref:System.Single?displayProperty=nameWithType> type.) Notice that there is no [double](double.md) in the expression.
