# in (C# Reference)

The `in` keyword is used in four contexts:  
  
- [generic type parameters](in-generic-modifier.md) in generic interfaces and delegates.
- As a [parameter modifier](in-parameter-modifier.md), which lets you pass an argument to a method by reference rather than by value.
- [foreach](foreach-in.md) statements.
- [from clauses](from-clause.md) in LINQ query expressions.
- [join clauses](join-clause.md) in LINQ query expressions.
