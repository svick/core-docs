# Iteration Statements (C# Reference)

You can create loops by using the iteration statements. Iteration statements cause embedded statements to be executed a number of times, subject to the loop-termination criteria. These statements are executed in order, except when a [jump statement](jump-statements.md) is encountered.

The following keywords are used in iteration statements:

- [do](do.md)

- [for](for.md)

- [foreach, in](foreach-in.md)

- [while](while.md)
