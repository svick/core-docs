# sizeof (C# Reference)
Used to obtain the size in bytes for an unmanaged type.

Unmanaged types include:

-   The simple types that are listed in the following table:
  
   |Expression|Constant value|  
   |----------------|--------------------|  
   |`sizeof(sbyte)`|1|  
   |`sizeof(byte)`|1|  
   |`sizeof(short)`|2|  
   |`sizeof(ushort)`|2|  
   |`sizeof(int)`|4|  
   |`sizeof(uint)`|4|  
   |`sizeof(long)`|8|  
   |`sizeof(ulong)`|8|  
   |`sizeof(char)`|2 (Unicode)|  
   |`sizeof(float)`|4|  
   |`sizeof(double)`|8|  
   |`sizeof(decimal)`|16|  
   |`sizeof(bool)`|1| 
  
-   Enum types.
  
-   Pointer types.
  
-   User-defined structs that do not contain any instance fields or auto-implemented instance properties that are reference types or constructed types.
  
 The following example shows how to retrieve the size of an `int`:  
  
```csharp  
// Constant value 4:  
int intSize = sizeof(int);   
```  
  
## Remarks  
 Starting with version 2.0 of C#, applying `sizeof` to simple or enum types no longer requires that code be compiled in an [unsafe](unsafe.md) context.
  
 The `sizeof` operator cannot be overloaded. The values returned by the `sizeof` operator are of type `int`. The previous table shows the constant values that are substituted for `sizeof` expressions that have certain simple types as operands.  
    
 For all other types, including structs, the `sizeof` operator can be used only in unsafe code blocks. Although you can use the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.SizeOf%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method, the value returned by this method is not always the same as the value returned by `sizeof`. <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.SizeOf%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> returns the size after the type has been marshaled, whereas `sizeof` returns the size as it has been allocated by the common language runtime, including any padding.
