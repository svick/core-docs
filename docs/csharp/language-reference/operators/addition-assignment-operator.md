# += Operator (C# Reference)
The addition assignment operator.  
  
## Remarks  
 An expression using the `+=` assignment operator, such as  
  
```csharp  
x += y  
```  
  
 is equivalent to  
  
```csharp  
x = x + y  
```  
  
 except that `x` is only evaluated once. The meaning of the [+ operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/addition-operator.md) depends on the types of `x` and `y` (addition for numeric operands, concatenation for string operands, and so forth).  
  
 The `+=` operator cannot be overloaded directly, but user-defined types can overload the [+ operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/addition-operator.md) (see [operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/operator.md)).  
  
 The `+=` operator is also used to specify a method that will be called in response to an event; such methods are called event handlers. The use of the `+=` operator in this context is referred to as *subscribing to an event*. For more information, see [How to: Subscribe to and Unsubscribe from Events](../../../csharp/programming-guide/events/how-to-subscribe-to-and-unsubscribe-from-events.md) and [Delegates](../../../csharp/programming-guide/delegates/index.md).
