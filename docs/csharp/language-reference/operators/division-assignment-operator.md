# /= Operator (C# Reference)
The division assignment operator.  
  
## Remarks  
 An expression using the `/=` assignment operator, such as  
  
```csharp  
x /= y  
```  
  
 is equivalent to  
  
```csharp  
x = x / y  
```  
  
 except that `x` is only evaluated once. The [/ operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/division-operator.md) is predefined for numeric types to perform division.  
  
 The `/=` operator cannot be overloaded directly, but user-defined types can overload the [/ operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/division-operator.md) (see [operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/operator.md)). On all compound assignment operators, overloading the binary operator implicitly overloads the equivalent compound assignment.
