# -= Operator (C# Reference)
The subtraction assignment operator.  
  
## Remarks  
 An expression using the `-=` assignment operator, such as  
  
```csharp  
x -= y  
```  
  
 is equivalent to  
  
```csharp  
x = x - y  
```  
  
 except that `x` is only evaluated once. The meaning of the [- operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/subtraction-operator.md) is dependent on the types of `x` and `y` (subtraction for numeric operands, delegate removal for delegate operands, and so forth).  
  
 The `-=` operator cannot be overloaded directly, but user-defined types can overload the [- operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/subtraction-operator.md) (see [operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/operator.md)).  
  
 The -= operator is also used in C# to unsubscribe from an event. For more information, see [How to: Subscribe to and Unsubscribe from Events](../../../csharp/programming-guide/events/how-to-subscribe-to-and-unsubscribe-from-events.md).
