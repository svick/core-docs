# / Operator (C# Reference)
The division operator (`/`) divides its first operand by its second operand. All numeric types have predefined division operators.
  
## Remarks  
 User-defined types can overload the `/` operator (see [operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/operator.md)). An overload of the `/` operator implicitly overloads the [/= operator](division-assignment-operator.md).  
  
 When you divide two integers, the result is always an integer. For example, the result of 7 / 3 is 2. This is not to be confused with floored division, as the `/` operator rounds towards zero: -7 / 3 is -2.  
  
 To obtain a quotient as a rational number, use the `float`, `double`, or `decimal` types. There are many ways to convert between [built in numeric types](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/reference-tables-for-types.md).  
  
 To determine the remainder, use the [remainder operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/remainder-operator.md) `%`.
