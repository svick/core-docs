# &lt;&lt;= Operator (C# Reference)
The left-shift assignment operator.  
  
## Remarks  
 An expression of the form  
  
```csharp  
x <<= y  
```  
  
 is evaluated as  
  
```csharp  
x = x << y  
```  
  
 except that `x` is only evaluated once. The [<< operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/left-shift-operator.md) shifts `x` left by the number of bits specified by `y`.  
  
 The `<<=` operator cannot be overloaded directly, but user-defined types can overload the [<< operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/left-shift-operator.md) (see [operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/operator.md)).
