# | Operator (C# Reference)
Binary `|` operators are predefined for the integral types and `bool`. For integral types, `|` computes the bitwise OR of its operands. For `bool` operands, `|` computes the logical OR of its operands; that is, the result is `false` if and only if both its operands are `false`.  
  
## Remarks  
 The binary `|` operator evaluates both operands regardless of the first one's value, in contrast to the [conditional-OR operator](conditional-or-operator.md) `||`.
 
 User-defined types can overload the `|` operator (see [operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/operator.md)).
