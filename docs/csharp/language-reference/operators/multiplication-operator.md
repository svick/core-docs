# * Operator (C# Reference)
The multiplication operator (`*`) computes the product of its operands. All numeric types have predefined multiplication operators.  

`*` also serves as the dereference operator, which allows reading and writing to a pointer.
  
## Remarks  
 The `*` operator is also used to declare pointer types and to dereference pointers. This operator can only be used in unsafe contexts, denoted by the use of the [unsafe](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/unsafe.md) keyword, and requiring the [/unsafe](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/unsafe-compiler-option.md) compiler option.  The dereference operator is also known as the indirection operator.  
  
 User-defined types can overload the binary `*` operator (see [operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/operator.md)). When a binary operator is overloaded, the corresponding assignment operator, if any, is also implicitly overloaded.
