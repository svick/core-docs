# &amp;= Operator (C# Reference)
The AND assignment operator.  
  
## Remarks  
 An expression using the `&=` assignment operator, such as  
  
```csharp  
x &= y  
```  
  
 is equivalent to  
  
```csharp  
x = x & y  
```  
  
 except that `x` is only evaluated once. The [& operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/and-operator.md) performs a bitwise logical AND operation on integral operands and logical AND on `bool` operands.  
  
 The `&=` operator cannot be overloaded directly, but user-defined types can overload the binary [& operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/and-operator.md) (see [operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/operator.md)).
