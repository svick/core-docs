# + Operator (C# Reference)
The `+` operator can function as either a unary or a binary operator.  
  
## Remarks  
 Unary `+` operators are predefined for all numeric types. The result of a unary `+` operation on a numeric type is just the value of the operand.  
  
 Binary `+` operators are predefined for numeric and string types. For numeric types, + computes the sum of its two operands. When one or both operands are of type string, + concatenates the string representations of the operands.  
  
 Delegate types also provide a binary `+` operator, which performs delegate concatenation.  
  
 User-defined types can overload the unary `+` and binary `+` operators. Operations on integral types are generally allowed on enumeration. For more information, see [operator (C# Reference)](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/operator.md).
