# ?: Operator (C# Reference)
The conditional operator (`?:`), commonly known as the ternary conditional operator, returns one of two values depending on the value of a Boolean expression. Following is the syntax for the conditional operator.  
  
```  
condition ? first_expression : second_expression;  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 The `condition` must evaluate to `true` or `false`. If `condition` is `true`, `first_expression` is evaluated and becomes the result. If `condition` is `false`, `second_expression` is evaluated and becomes the result. Only one of the two expressions is evaluated.  
  
 Either the type of `first_expression` and `second_expression` must be the same, or an implicit conversion must exist from one type to the other.  
  
 You can express calculations that might otherwise require an `if-else` construction more concisely by using the conditional operator. For example, the following code uses first an `if` statement and then a conditional operator to classify an integer as positive or negative.  
  
```csharp
int input = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());  
string classify;  
  
// if-else construction.  
if (input > 0)  
    classify = "positive";  
else  
    classify = "negative";  
  
// ?: conditional operator.  
classify = (input > 0) ? "positive" : "negative";  
```  
  
 The conditional operator is right-associative. The expression `a ? b : c ? d : e` is evaluated as `a ? b : (c ? d : e)`, not as `(a ? b : c) ? d : e`.  
  
 The conditional operator cannot be overloaded.
