# %= Operator (C# Reference)

The remainder assignment operator.

An expression using the `%=` operator, such as  

```csharp
x %= y
```  

is equivalent to  

```csharp
x = x % y
```  

except that `x` is only evaluated once.
  
The [remainder operator](remainder-operator.md) `%` computes the remainder after division of its operands. It's supported by all numeric types.

If a user-defined type [overloads](../keywords/operator.md) the [remainder operator](remainder-operator.md) `%`, the remainder assignment operator `%=` is implicitly overloaded.
  
The following example demonstrates the usage of the `%=` operator:
