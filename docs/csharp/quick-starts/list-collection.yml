    This quickstart teaches you C# interactively, using your browser to write C# code and see the results of compiling and running your code. It contains a series of lessons that create, modify and explore collections and arrays.
- title: Create lists
  durationInMinutes: 2
  content: |
    Run the following code in the interactive window. To do that, type the following code block in the interactive window (replace `<name>` with your name) and click the **Run** button:

    ```csharp
    var names = new List<string> { "<name>", "Ana", "Felipe" };
    foreach (var name in names)
    {
      Console.WriteLine($"Hello {name.ToUpper()}!");
    }
    ```

    You've just created a list of strings, added three names to that list, and printed out the names in all CAPS. You're using concepts
    that you've learned in earlier quickstarts to loop through the list.

    The code to display names makes use of the [string interpolation](../language-reference/tokens/interpolated.md) feature. When you precede a `string` with the `$` character, you can embed C# code in the string declaration. The actual string replaces that C# code with the value it generates. In this example, it replaces the `{name.ToUpper()}` with each name, converted to capital letters, because you called the <xref:System.String.ToUpper%2A> method.

    Let's keep exploring.

- title: Modify list contents
  durationInMinutes: 3
  content: |
    The collection you created uses the <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601> type. This type stores sequences of elements. You specify the type of the elements between the angle brackets.
    
    One important aspect of this <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601> type is that it can grow or shrink, enabling you to add or remove elements. Add the following code below the code you've already written:

    ```csharp
    Console.WriteLine();
    names.Add("Maria");
    names.Add("Bill");
    names.Remove("Ana");
    foreach (var name in names)
    {
      Console.WriteLine($"Hello {name.ToUpper()}!");
    }
    ```

    You've added two more names to the end of the list. You've also removed one as well.
    
    The <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601> enables you to reference individual items by **index** as well. You access items using the `[` and `]` tokens. Add the following code below what you've already written and try it:

    ```csharp
    Console.WriteLine($"My name is {names[0]}.");
    Console.WriteLine($"I've added {names[2]} and {names[3]} to the list.");
    ```

    You're not allowed to access past the end of the list. You can check how long the list is using the <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601.Count%2A> property. Add the following code to try it:

    ```csharp
    Console.WriteLine($"The list has {names.Count} people in it");
    ```
    
    Click **Run** again to see the results. In C#, indices start at 0, so the largest valid index is one less than the number of items in the list.

- title: Search and sort lists
  durationInMinutes: 5
  content: |
    Our samples use relatively small lists, but your applications may often create lists with many more elements, sometimes numbering in the thousands. To find elements in these larger collections, you need to search the list for different items. The <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601.IndexOf%2A> method searches for an item and returns the index of the item. Try this to see how it works.  Add the following code below what you've written so far:

    ```csharp
    var index = names.IndexOf("Felipe");
    if (index != -1)
      Console.WriteLine($"The name {names[index]} is at index {index}");

    var notFound = names.IndexOf("Not Found");
      Console.WriteLine($"When an item is not found, IndexOf returns {notFound}");
    ```

    You may not know if an item is in the list, so you should always check the index returned by <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601.IndexOf%2A>. If it is -1, the item was not found.

    The items in your list can be sorted as well. The <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601.Sort%2A> method sorts all the items in the list in their normal order (alphabetically in the case of strings). Add this code and run again:

    ```csharp
    names.Sort();
    foreach (var name in names)
    {
      Console.WriteLine($"Hello {name.ToUpper()}!");
    }
    ```

- title: Lists of other types
  durationInMinutes: 5
  content: |
    You've been using the `string` type in lists so far. Let's make a <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601> using a different type. Let's build a set of numbers. Delete the code you wrote so far, and replace it with this:

    ```csharp
    var fibonacciNumbers = new List<int> {1, 1};
    ```

    That creates a list of integers, and sets the first two integers to the value 1. These are the first two values of a *Fibonacci Sequence*, a sequence of numbers. Each next Fibonacci number is found by taking the sum of the previous two numbers. Add this code:

    ```csharp
    var previous = fibonacciNumbers[fibonacciNumbers.Count - 1];
    var previous2 = fibonacciNumbers[fibonacciNumbers.Count - 2];
    
    fibonacciNumbers.Add(previous + previous2);

    foreach(var item in fibonacciNumbers)
        Console.WriteLine(item);
    ```

    Press **Run** to see the results;

  durationInMinutes: 10

    See if you can put together some of the concepts from this and earlier lessons. Expand on what you've built so far with Fibonacci Numbers. Try and write the code to generate the first 20 numbers in the sequence. (As a hint, the 20th Fibonacci number is 6765.)

- title: Complete challenge
  durationInMinutes: 3

    Did you come up with something like this?

    ```csharp
    var fibonacciNumbers = new List<int> {1, 1};

    while (fibonacciNumbers.Count < 20)
    {
        var previous = fibonacciNumbers[fibonacciNumbers.Count - 1];
        var previous2 = fibonacciNumbers[fibonacciNumbers.Count - 2];
        
        fibonacciNumbers.Add(previous + previous2);
    }
    foreach(var item in fibonacciNumbers)
        Console.WriteLine(item);
    ```

    With each iteration of the loop, you're taking the last two integers in the list, summing them, and adding that value to the list. The loop repeats until you've added 20 items to the list.

    You've completed the list quickstart. This quickstart is the final interactive quickstart. You can continue these quickstarts on your own development environment. Learn the basics of [local development](local-environment.md) and then pick a quickstart. You can try this same exercise, move directly to the next quickstart, or start again at with the [numbers in C#](numbers-in-csharp-local.md) quickstart.

    You can learn more about working with the `List` type in the
    [.NET Guide](../../standard/index.md) topic on [collections](../../standard/collections/index.md). You'll also learn about many other collection types.
