# Local environment

The first step to trying a quickstart locally is to setup a development environment on your local machine.
The .NET topic [Get Started in 10 minutes](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core) has instructions for setting
up your local development environment on Mac, PC or Linux.

Alternatively, you can install the [.NET Core SDK](http://dot.net/core) and
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Basic application development flow

You'll create applications using the [`dotnet new`](../../core/tools/dotnet-new.md) command. This command
generates the files and assets necessary for your application. The quickstarts all use the `console` application
type.

The other commands you'll use are [`dotnet build`](../../core/tools/dotnet-build.md) to build the executable,
and [`dotnet run`](../../core/tools/dotnet-run.md) to run the executable.

## Pick your quickstart

You can start with any of the following quickstarts:

## [Numbers in C#](numbers-in-csharp-local.md)

In the [Numbers in C#](numbers-in-csharp-local.md) quickstart, you'll learn
how computers store numbers and how to perform calculations with different
numeric types. You'll learn the basics of rounding, and how to perform
mathematical calculations using C#. 

This quickstart assumes that you have finished the [Hello world](hello-world.yml) lesson.

## [Branches and loops](branches-and-loops-local.md)

The [Branches and loops](branches-and-loops-local.md) quickstart teaches the basics of selecting
different paths of code execution based on the values stored in variables. You'll learn the
basics of control flow, which is the basis of how programs make decisions and choose
different actions. 

This quickstart assumes that you have finished the [Hello world](hello-world.yml) and
[Numbers in C#](numbers-in-csharp-local.md) lessons.

## [String interpolation](interpolated-strings-local.md)

The [String interpolation](interpolated-strings-local.md) quickstart shows you how to insert values into a string. You'll learn how to create an interpolated string with embedded C# expressions and how to control the text appearance of the expression results in the result string.

This quickstart assumes that you have finished the [Hello world](hello-world.yml), [Numbers in C#](numbers-in-csharp-local.md), and [Branches and loops](branches-and-loops-local.md) lessons.

## [List collection](arrays-and-collections.md)

The [List collection](arrays-and-collections.md) lesson gives you
a tour of the List collection type that stores sequences of data. You'll learn how to add and remove items, search for items, and sort the lists. You'll explore different kinds of lists. 

This quickstart assumes that you have finished the lessons listed above.

## [Introduction to classes](introduction-to-classes.md)

This final quickstart is only available to run on your machine, using your own local development environment and .NET Core.
You'll build a console application and see the basic object-oriented features that are part of the C# language.
