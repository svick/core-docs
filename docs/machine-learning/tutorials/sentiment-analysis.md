## Sentiment analysis sample overview

The sample is a console app that uses ML.NET to train a model that classifies and predicts sentiment as either positive or negative. It also evaluates the model with a second dataset for quality analysis. The sentiment datasets are from the WikiDetox project.

## Prerequisites

* [Visual Studio 2017 15.6 or later](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?utm_medium=microsoft&utm_source=docs.microsoft.com&utm_campaign=button+cta&utm_content=download+vs2017) with the ".NET Core cross-platform development" workload installed.

* The [Wikipedia detox line data tab separated file (wikiPedia-detox-250-line-data.tsv)](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/master/test/data/wikipedia-detox-250-line-data.tsv).
* The [Wikipedia detox line test tab separated file (wikipedia-detox-250-line-test.tsv)](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/master/test/data/wikipedia-detox-250-line-test.tsv).

## Machine learning workflow

This tutorial follows a machine learning workflow that enables the process to move in an orderly fashion.

The workflow phases are as follows:

1. **Understand the problem**
2. **Ingest the data**
3. **Data preprocess and feature engineering**
4. **Train and predict the model**
5. **Evaluate the model**
6. **Model operationalization**

### Understand the problem

You first need to understand the problem, so you can break it down to parts that can support building and training the model. Breaking the problem down allows you to predict and evaluate the results.

The problem for this tutorial is to understand incoming website comment sentiment to take the appropriate action.

You can break down the problem to the sentiment text and sentiment value for the data you want to train the model with, and a predicted sentiment value that you can evaluate and then use operationally.

You then need to **determine** the sentiment, which helps you with the machine learning task selection.

## Select the appropriate machine learning task

With this problem, you know the following facts:

Training data: website comments can be positive or negative (**sentiment**).
Predict the **sentiment** of a new website comment, either positive or negative, such as in the following examples:

* Please refrain from adding nonsense to Wikipedia.
* He is the best, and the article should say that.

The classification machine learning task is best suited for this scenario.

### About the classification task

Classification is a machine learning task that uses data to **determine** the category, type, or class of an item or row of data. For example, you can use classification to:

* Identify sentiment as positive or negative.
* Classify email as spam, junk, or good.
* Determine whether a patient's lab sample is cancerous.
* Categorize customers by their propensity to respond to a sales campaign.

Classification tasks are frequently one of the following types:

* Binary: either A or B.
* Multiclass: multiple categories that can be predicted by using a single model.

## Create a console application

1. Open Visual Studio 2017. Select **File** > **New** > **Project** from the menu bar. In the **New Project** dialog, select the **Visual C#** node followed by the **.NET Core** node. Then select the **Console App (.NET Core)** project template. In the **Name** text box, type "SentimentAnalysis" and then select the **OK** button.

2. Create a directory named *Data* in your project to save your data set files:

    In **Solution Explorer**, right-click on your project and select **Add** > **New Folder**. Type "Data" and hit Enter.

3. Install the **Microsoft.ML NuGet Package**:

    In Solution Explorer, right-click on your project and select **Manage NuGet Packages**. Choose "nuget.org" as the Package source, select the Browse tab, search for **Microsoft.ML**, select that package in the list, and select the **Install** button. Select the **OK** button on the **Preview Changes** dialog and then select the **I Accept** button on the **License Acceptance** dialog if you agree with the license terms for the packages listed.

### Prepare your data

1. Download the [WikiPedia detox-250-line-data.tsv](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/master/test/data/wikipedia-detox-250-line-data.tsv) and the [wikipedia-detox-250-line-test.tsv](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/master/test/data/wikipedia-detox-250-line-test.tsv) data sets and save them to the *Data* folder previously created. The first dataset trains the machine learning model and the second can be used to evaluate how accurate your model is.

2. In Solution Explorer, right-click each of the \*.tsv files and select **Properties**. Under **Advanced**, change the value of **Copy to Output Directory** to **Copy if newer**.

### Create classes and define paths

Add the following additional `using` statements to the top of the *Program.cs* file:

[!code-csharp[AddUsings](../../../samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#1 "Add necessary usings")]

You need to create three global fields to hold the paths to the recently downloaded files:

* `_dataPath` has the path to the dataset used to train the model.
* `_testDataPath` has the path to the dataset used to evaluate the model.
* `_modelPath` has the path where the trained model is saved.

Add the following code to the line right above the `Main` method to specify those paths:

[!code-csharp[Declare file variables](../../../samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#2 "Declare variables to store data files")]

You need to create some classes for your input data and predictions. Add a new class to your project:

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the project, and then select **Add** > **New Item**.

1. In the **Add New Item** dialog box, select **Class** and change the **Name** field to *SentimentData.cs*. Then, select the **Add** button.

    The *SentimentData.cs* file opens in the code editor. Add the following `using` statement to the top of *SentimentData.cs*:

[!code-csharp[AddUsings](../../../samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/SentimentData.cs#1 "Add necessary usings")]

Remove the existing class definition and add the following code, which has two classes `SentimentData` and `SentimentPrediction`, to the *SentimentData.cs* file:

[!code-csharp[DeclareTypes](../../../samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/SentimentData.cs#2 "Declare data record types")]

`SentimentData` is the input dataset class and has a `float` (`Sentiment`) that has a value for sentiment of either positive or negative, and a string for the comment (`SentimentText`). Both fields have `Column` attributes attached to them. This attribute describes the order of each field in the data file, and which is the `Label` field. `SentimentPrediction` is the class used for prediction after the model has been trained. It has a single boolean (`Sentiment`) and a `PredictedLabel` `ColumnName` attribute. The `Label` is used to create and train the model, and it's also used with a second dataset to evaluate the model. The `PredictedLabel` is used during prediction and evaluation. For evaluation, an input with training data, the predicted values, and the model are used.

In the *Program.cs* file, change the `Main` method signature by replacing `void` with `async Task`, as in the following example:

```csharp
static async Task Main(string[] args) 
{

}
```

You add `async` to `Main` with a <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task> return type because you're saving the model to a zip file later, and the program needs to wait until that external task completes.

> [!NOTE]
> An *async main* method enables you to use `await` in your `Main` method. For more information, see the
[async main](../../../docs/csharp/programming-guide/main-and-command-args/index.md) topic in the C# programming guide.

Replace the `Console.WriteLine("Hello World!")` line with the following code in the `Main` method:

[!code-csharp[Train](../../../samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#3 "Train your model")]

The `Train` method executes the following tasks:

* Loads or ingests the data.
* Preprocesses and featurizes the data.
* Trains the model.
* Predicts sentiment based on test data.

Create the `Train` method, just after the `Main` method, using the following code:

```csharp
public static async Task<PredictionModel<SentimentData, SentimentPrediction>> Train()
{

}
```

## Ingest the data

Initialize a new instance of <xref:Microsoft.ML.Legacy.LearningPipeline> that will include the data loading, data processing/featurization, and model. Add the following code as the first line of the `Train` method:

[!code-csharp[LearningPipeline](../../../samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#5 "Create a learning pipeline")]

The <xref:Microsoft.ML.Legacy.Data.TextLoader> object is the first part of the pipeline, and loads the training file data.

[!code-csharp[TextLoader](../../../samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#6 "Add a text loader to the pipeline")]

## Data preprocess and feature engineering

Pre-processing and cleaning data are important tasks that occur before a dataset is used effectively for machine learning. Raw data is often noisy and unreliable, and may be missing values. Using data without these modeling tasks can produce misleading results. ML.NET's transform pipelines allow you to compose a custom set of transforms that are applied to your data before training or testing. The transforms' primary purpose is for data featurization. A transform pipeline's advantage is that after transform pipeline definition, save the pipeline to apply it to test data.

Apply a <xref:Microsoft.ML.Legacy.Transforms.TextFeaturizer> to convert the `SentimentText` column into a [numeric vector](../resources/glossary.md#numerical-feature-vector) called `Features` used by the machine learning algorithm. This is the preprocessing/featurization step. Using additional components available in ML.NET can enable better results with your model. Add `TextFeaturizer` to the pipeline as the next line of code:

[!code-csharp[TextFeaturizer](../../../samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#7 "Add a TextFeaturizer to the pipeline")]

## Choose a learning algorithm

The <xref:Microsoft.ML.Legacy.Trainers.FastTreeBinaryClassifier> object is a decision tree learner you'll use in this pipeline. Similar to the featurization step, trying out different learners available in ML.NET and changing their parameters leads to different results. For tuning, you can set [hyperparameters](../resources/glossary.md#hyperparameter) like <xref:Microsoft.ML.Legacy.Trainers.FastTreeBinaryClassifier.NumTrees>, <xref:Microsoft.ML.Legacy.Trainers.FastTreeBinaryClassifier.NumLeaves>, and <xref:Microsoft.ML.Legacy.Trainers.FastTreeBinaryClassifier.MinDocumentsInLeafs>. These hyperparameters are set before anything affects the model and are model-specific. They're used to tune the decision tree for performance, so larger values can negatively impact performance.

Add the following code to the `Train` method:

[!code-csharp[BinaryClassifier](../../../samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#8 "Add a fast binary tree classifier")]

## Train the model

You train the model, <xref:Microsoft.ML.Legacy.PredictionModel%602>, based on the dataset that has been loaded and transformed. `pipeline.Train<SentimentData, SentimentPrediction>()` trains the pipeline (loads the data, trains the featurizer and learner). The experiment is not executed until this happens.

Add the following code to the `Train` method:

[!code-csharp[TrainModel](../../../samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#9 "Train the model")]

### Save and Return the model trained to use for evaluation

At this point, you have a model that can be integrated into any of your existing or new .NET applications. To save your model to a .zip file before returning, add the following code to the next line in `Train`:

[!code-csharp[SaveModel](../../../samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#10 "Save the model")]

Return the model at the end of the `Train` method.

[!code-csharp[ReturnModel](../../../samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#11 "Return the model")]

## Evaluate the model

Now that you've created and trained the model, you need to evaluate it with a different dataset for quality assurance and validation. In the `Evaluate` method, the model created in `Train` is passed in to be evaluated. Create the `Evaluate` method, just after `Train`, as in the following code:

```csharp
public static void Evaluate(PredictionModel<SentimentData, SentimentPrediction> model)
{

}
```

The `Evaluate` method executes the following tasks:

* Loads the test dataset.
* Creates the binary evaluator.
* Evaluates the model and create metrics.
* Displays the metrics.

Add a call to the new method from the `Main` method, right under the `Train` method call, using the following code:

[!code-csharp[CallEvaluate](../../../samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#12 "Call the Evaluate method")]

The <xref:Microsoft.ML.Legacy.Data.TextLoader> class loads the new test dataset with the same schema. You can evaluate the model using this dataset as a quality check. Add the following code to the `Evaluate` method:

[!code-csharp[LoadText](../../../samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#13 "Load the test dataset")]

The <xref:Microsoft.ML.Legacy.Models.BinaryClassificationEvaluator> object computes the quality metrics for the `PredictionModel` using the specified dataset. To see those metrics, add the evaluator as the next line in the `Evaluate` method, with the following code:

[!code-csharp[BinaryEvaluator](../../../samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#14 "Create the binary evaluator")]

The <xref:Microsoft.ML.Legacy.Models.BinaryClassificationMetrics> contains the overall metrics computed by binary classification evaluators. To display these to determine the quality of the model, you need to get the metrics first. Add the following code:

[!code-csharp[CreateMetrics](../../../samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#15 "Evaluate the model and create metrics")]

### Displaying the metrics for model validation

Use the following code to display the metrics, share the results, and then act on them:

[!code-csharp[DisplayMetrics](../../../samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#16 "Display selected metrics")]

## Predict the test data outcomes with the model

Create the `Predict` method, just after the `Evaluate` method, using the following code:

```csharp
public static void Predict(PredictionModel<SentimentData, SentimentPrediction> model)
{

}
```

The `Predict` method executes the following tasks:

* Creates test data.
* Predicts sentiment based on test data.
* Combines test data and predictions for reporting.
* Displays the predicted results.

Add a call to the new method from the `Main` method, right under the `Evaluate` method call, using the following code:

[!code-csharp[CallEvaluate](../../../samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#17 "Call the Predict method")]

Add some comments to test the trained model's predictions in the `Predict` method:

[!code-csharp[PredictionData](../../../samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#18 "Create test data for predictions")]

Now that you have a model, you can use that to predict the positive or negative sentiment of the comment data using the <xref:Microsoft.ML.Legacy.PredictionModel.Predict%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method. To get a prediction, use `Predict` on new data. Note that the input data is a string and the model includes the featurization. Your pipeline is in sync during training and prediction. You didn’t have to write preprocessing/featurization code specifically for predictions, and the same API takes care of both batch and one-time predictions.

[!code-csharp[Predict](../../../samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#19 "Create predictions of sentiments")]

### Model operationalization: prediction

Display `SentimentText` and corresponding sentiment prediction in order to share the results and act on them accordingly. This is called operationalization, using the returned data as part of the operational policies. Create a header for the results using the following <xref:System.Console.WriteLine?displayProperty=nameWithType> code:

[!code-csharp[OutputHeaders](../../../samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#20 "Display prediction outputs")]

Before displaying the predicted results, combine the sentiment and prediction together to see the original comment with its predicted sentiment. The following code uses the <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Zip%2A> method to make that happen, so add that code next:

[!code-csharp[BuildTuples](../../../samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#21 "Build the pairs of sentiment data and predictions")]

Now that you've combined the `SentimentText` and `Sentiment` into a class, you can display the results using the <xref:System.Console.WriteLine?displayProperty=nameWithType> method:

[!code-csharp[DisplayPredictions](../../../samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#22 "Display the predictions")]

Because inferred tuple element names are a new feature in C# 7.1 and the default language version of the project is C# 7.0, you need to change the language version to C# 7.1 or higher.
To do that, right-click on the project node in **Solution Explorer** and select **Properties**. Select the **Build** tab and select the **Advanced** button. In the dropdown, select  **C# 7.1** (or a higher version). Select the **OK** button.

## Results

Your results should be similar to the following. As the pipeline processes, it displays messages. You may see warnings, or processing messages. These have been removed from the following results for clarity.

```
