# global.json reference

The *global.json* file allows selection of the .NET Core tools version being used through the `sdk` property.

.NET Core CLI tools look for this file in the current working directory (which isn't necessarily the same as the project directory) or one of its parent directories.

## sdk
Type: Object

Specifies information about the SDK.

### version
Type: String

The version of the SDK to use.

For example:

```json
{
  "sdk": {
    "version": "1.0.0-preview2-003121"
  }
}
```
