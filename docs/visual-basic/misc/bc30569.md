# &#39;New&#39; cannot be used on a class that is declared &#39;MustInherit&#39;
A `MustInherit` class cannot be instantiated directly, and therefore the `New` operator cannot be used on a `MustInherit` class. Although it's possible to have variables and values whose compile time types are `MustInherit`, such variables and values will necessarily either be a null value or contain references to instances of regular classes derived from the `MustInherit` types.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30569  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Remove the `New` operator.
