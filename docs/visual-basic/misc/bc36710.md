# Extension method &#39;&lt;methodname&gt;&#39; defined in &#39;&lt;modulename&gt;&#39; does not have a signature compatible with delegate &#39;&lt;delegatename&gt;&#39;
There is a mismatch between the signatures of the extension method and the delegate that you are trying to use. The `Delegate` statement defines the parameter types and return types of a delegate class. Any procedure with compatible parameters, parameter types, and return type may be used to create an instance of this delegate type.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36710
