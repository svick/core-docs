# &#39;GoTo &lt;labelname&gt;&#39; is not valid because &#39;&lt;labelname&gt;&#39; is inside a &#39;For&#39; or &#39;For Each&#39; statement that does not contain this statement
`GoTo` statements are restricted to jumps within the current block of code.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30757  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Restructure your code so that the `GoTo` statement and the label are both inside the `For` block.
