# &#39;Class_Initialize&#39; event is no longer supported
'Class_Initialize' event is no longer supported. Use 'Sub New' to initialize a class.  
  
 The `Class_Initialize` event of previous versions of Visual Basic is replaced by class constructors.  
  
 By default, this message is a warning. For information on hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC42001  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Declare one or more `Sub` procedures named `New` to initialize a class. `Sub New` is called when a class instance is newly created.
