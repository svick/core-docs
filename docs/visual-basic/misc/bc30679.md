# Array initializers are valid only for arrays, but the type of &#39;&lt;variablename&gt;&#39; is &#39;&lt;typename&gt;&#39;
An attempt was made to initialize a non-array variable with a list of values.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30679  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Declare and initialize the variable as an array; for example:  
  
     `Dim intarray As Integer() = {1, 5, 9}`  
  
-   Initialize the variable as a single value; for example:  
  
     `Dim intvalue As Integer = 1`
