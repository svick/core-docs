# Operator &#39;&lt;operatorname&gt;&#39; is not defined for types &#39;&lt;typename1&gt;&#39; and &#39;&lt;typename2&gt;&#39;
Operator '\<operatorname>' is not defined for types '\<typename1>' and '\<typename2>'. Use 'Is' operator to compare two reference types.  
  
 An attempt was made to use an operator in a way that is inappropriate for the specified types. This error can be caused by using the "=" operator instead of using the `Is` operator to compare two objects.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31080  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Use `Is` operator to compare two reference types.  
  
2.  Use the `Not` operator in conjunction with the `Is` operator to denote inequality. For example:
