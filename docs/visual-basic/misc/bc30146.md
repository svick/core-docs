# Unable to sign assembly: &lt;error message&gt;
The Visual Basic compiler calls the Assembly Linker (Al.exe, also known as Alink) to generate an assembly with a manifest. The linker has reported an error signing the assembly after it was created. This might be due to an invalid key.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30146  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Examine the quoted error message and consult the topic  [Al.exe (Assembly Linker)](../../framework/tools/al-exe-assembly-linker.md) for further explanation and advice.  
  
2.  If the error persists, gather information about the circumstances and notify Microsoft Product Support Services.
