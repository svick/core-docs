# Methods declared &#39;Overrides&#39; cannot be declared &#39;Overridable&#39; because they are implicitly overridable
Unlike most methods, methods marked with the `Overrides` modifier are overridable by default.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30730  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Omit the `Overridable` modifier from methods marked with the `Overrides` modifier.
