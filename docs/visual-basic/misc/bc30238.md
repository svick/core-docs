# &#39;Loop&#39; cannot have a condition if matching &#39;Do&#39; has one
A `Loop` statement contains a `While` or `Until` clause, and the corresponding `Do` statement also contains such a clause. Only one of the `Do` and `Loop` statements in a loop can specify a condition.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30238  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Remove the `While` or `Until` clause from either the `Do` statement or the `Loop` statement.
