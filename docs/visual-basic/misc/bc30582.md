# &#39;SyncLock&#39; operand cannot be of type &#39;&lt;typename&gt;&#39; because &#39;&lt;typename&gt;&#39; is not a reference type
The `SyncLock` statement allows statements to be synchronized on a single expression by ensuring that multiple threads do not execute the same statements at the same time. The type of expression in a `SyncLock` statement must be a reference type, such as a class, a module, an interface, an array, or a delegate.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30582  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Change the type to an appropriate reference type.
