# &#39;AddressOf&#39; expression cannot be converted to &#39;&lt;typename&gt;&#39; because type &#39;&lt;typename&gt;&#39; is declared &#39;MustInherit&#39; and cannot be created
A statement attempts to convert an `AddressOf` expression to a type that can only be a base class and cannot be used to create an instance.  
  
 The `AddressOf` operator creates a procedure delegate instance that references a specific procedure.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30939  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Assign the `AddressOf` expression to a specific delegate type.
