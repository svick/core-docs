# &#39;Select Case&#39; must end with a matching &#39;End Select&#39;
A `Select` or `Select Case` statement occurs without a corresponding `End Select` statement. An `End Select` statement must be used to end the `Select` block.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30095  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  If this `Select` block is part of a set of nested `Select` blocks, make sure each block is properly terminated.  
  
2.  Add an `End Select` statement to the end of the `Select` block.
