# &#39;&lt;name&gt;&#39; is ambiguous in the application objects &#39;&lt;list&gt;&#39;
You have provided a name that is ambiguous and therefore conflicts with another name. The Visual Basic compiler does not have any conflict resolution rules; you must disambiguate names yourself. The list provided in the error message details the application objects where the name is ambiguous.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30563  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Fully qualify the name.
