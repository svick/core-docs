# How to: Print a Scrollable Form (Visual Basic)
The <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm> component enables you to quickly print an image of a form without using a <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component. By default, only the currently visible part of the form is printed; if a user has resized the form at run time, the image may not print as intended. The following procedure shows how to print the complete client area of a scrollable form, even if the form has been resized.  
  
 The PowerPack controls are no longer included in Visual Studio, but you can download them from the [Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=25169).  
  
### To print the complete client area of a scrollable form  
  
1.  In the **Toolbox**, click the **Visual Basic PowerPacks** tab and then drag the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm> component onto the form.  
  
     The <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm> component will be added to the component tray.  
  
2.  In the **Properties** window, set the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm.PrintAction%2A> property to <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintAction.PrintToPrinter>.  
  
3.  Add the following code in the appropriate event handler (for example, in the `Click` event handler for a **Print**`Button`).  
  
    ```  
    PrintForm1.Print(Me, PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm.PrintOption.Scrollable)  
    ```  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  On some operating systems, text or graphics drawn by <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> methods may not print correctly. In this case, you will not be able to print with the `Scrollable` parameter.
