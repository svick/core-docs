# Nothing and Strings in Visual Basic
The Visual Basic runtime and the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] evaluate `Nothing` differently when it comes to strings.  
  
## Visual Basic Runtime and the .NET Framework  
 Consider the following example:  
  
 [!code-vb[VbVbalrStrings#47](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/functions/codesnippet/VisualBasic/nothing-and-strings_1.vb)]  
  
 The Visual Basic runtime usually evaluates `Nothing` as an empty string (""). The [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] does not, however, and throws an exception whenever an attempt is made to perform a string operation on `Nothing`.
