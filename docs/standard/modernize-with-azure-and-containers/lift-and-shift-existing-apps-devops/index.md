# Lift and shift existing apps DevOps

> Vision: Lift and shift your existing .NET Framework applications to Cloud DevOps-Ready applications to drastically improve your deployment agility, so you can ship faster and lower app delivery costs.

To take advantage of the benefits of the cloud and new technologies like containers, you should at least partially modernize your existing .NET applications. Ultimately, modernizing your enterprise applications will lower your total cost of ownership.

Partially modernizing an app doesn't necessarily mean a full migration and re-architecture. You can initially modernize your existing applications by using a lift and shift process that's easy and fast. You can maintain your current code base, written in existing .NET Framework versions, with any Windows and IIS dependencies. Figure 4-1 highlights how Cloud DevOps-Ready apps are positioned in Azure application modernization maturity models.
