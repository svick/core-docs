# When not to deploy to Windows Containers

Some Windows technologies are not supported by Windows Containers. In those cases, you still need to migrate to standards VMs, usually with just Windows and IIS.

Cases not supported in Windows Containers, as of mid-2017:

-   Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) currently is not supported in Windows Containers.

    -   [UserVoice request forum](https://windowsserver.uservoice.com/forums/304624-containers/suggestions/15719031-create-base-container-image-with-msmq-server)

    -   [Discussion forum](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/bce99a7d-aa60-44fa-a348-450855650810/msmqserver-is-it-supported?forum=windowscontainers)

-   Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC) currently is not supported in Windows Containers

    -   [GitHub issue](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/Virtualization-Documentation/issues/494)
