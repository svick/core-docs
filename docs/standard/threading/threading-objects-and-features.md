# Threading objects and features

Along with the <xref:System.Threading.Thread?displayProperty=nameWithType> class, .NET provides a number of classes that help you develop multithreaded applications. The following articles provide overview of those classes:

|Title|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|[The managed thread pool](the-managed-thread-pool.md)|Describes the <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPool?displayProperty=nameWithType> class, which provides a pool of worker threads that are managed by .NET.|  
|[Timers](timers.md)|Describes .NET timers that can be used in a multithreaded environment.|
|[Overview of synchronization primitives](overview-of-synchronization-primitives.md)|Describes types that can be used to synchronize access to a shared resource or control thread interaction.|
|[EventWaitHandle, AutoResetEvent, CountdownEvent, ManualResetEvent](eventwaithandle-autoresetevent-countdownevent-manualresetevent.md)|Describes managed event wait handles, which are used to synchronize thread activities by signaling and waiting for signals.|
|[Mutexes](mutexes.md)|Describes <xref:System.Threading.Mutex?displayProperty=nameWithType>, which grants exclusive access to a shared resource.|
|[Interlocked operations](interlocked-operations.md)|Describes the <xref:System.Threading.Interlocked?displayProperty=nameWithType> class, which provides atomic operations for variables that are shared by multiple threads.|
|[Reader-Writer Locks](reader-writer-locks.md)|Describes the <xref:System.Threading.ReaderWriterLockSlim?displayProperty=nameWithType> class, which provides single-writer/multiple-reader access to a shared resource.|
|[Semaphore and SemaphoreSlim](semaphore-and-semaphoreslim.md)|Describes the <xref:System.Threading.Semaphore?displayProperty=nameWithType> class, which limits number of threads that can access a shared resource or a pool of resources concurrently.|
|[Barrier](barrier.md)|Describes the <xref:System.Threading.Barrier?displayProperty=nameWithType> class that implements the barrier pattern for coordination of threads in phased operations.|
|[SpinLock](spinlock.md)|Describes the <xref:System.Threading.SpinLock?displayProperty=nameWithType> structure, which is a lightweight alternative to the <xref:System.Threading.Monitor?displayProperty=nameWithType> class for certain low-level locking scenarios.|
|[SpinWait](spinwait.md)|Describes the <xref:System.Threading.SpinWait?displayProperty=nameWithType> structure, which provides support for spin-based waiting.|
