 [Data Contracts](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/data-contracts.md)  
 Demonstrates data contracts in WCF.  
  
 [Message Contracts](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/message-contracts.md)  
 Demonstrates message contracts in WCF.  
  
 [Service Contracts](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/service-contracts.md)  
 Demonstrates service contracts in WCF.  
  
 [DataContractResolver](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/datacontractresolver.md)  
 Demonstrates how the serialization and deserialization processes can be customized by using the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractResolver> class.  
  
 [KnownAssemblyAttribute](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/knownassemblyattribute.md)  
 Demonstrates how to dynamically add known types during serialization and deserialization.  
  
 [Using DataContractSerializer and DataContractResolver to Provide the Functionality of NetDataContractSerializer](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/datacontractserializer-datacontractresolver-netdatacontractserializer.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer> with an appropriate <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractResolver> provides the same functionality as <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.NetDataContractSerializer>.
