This section contains examples of Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) scenarios.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Activity Library](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/activity-library.md)  
 Contains samples that demonstrate scenarios using the built-in activity library.  
  
 [Services](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/services.md)  
 Contains samples that demonstrate scenarios using workflow services.  
  
 [Transactions](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/transactions.md)  
 Contains samples that demonstrate scenarios using transactions.  
  
 [Auto-Confirm Pattern](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/auto-confirm-pattern.md)  
 Consists of three scenarios that run illustrating a custom `AutoConfirmScope` activity.  
  
 [StateMachine Scenario Using a Combination of FlowChart and Pick](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/statemachine-scenario-using-a-combination-of-flowchart-and-pick.md)  
 Demonstrates how to implement a simple stopwatch scenario using a combination of the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Flowchart> and <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Pick> activities.  
  
 [WPF and WF Integration in XAML](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/wpf-and-wf-integration-in-xaml.md)  
 Demonstrates how to create an application that uses Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) features in a single XAML document. To accomplish this, the sample uses Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) and XAML extensibility.  
  
 [External Ruleset Toolkit](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/external-ruleset-toolkit.md)  
 Demonstrates how to manage and edit RuleSets in a database and access those RuleSets from a workflow at runtime.
