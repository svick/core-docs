# Basic Usage of SendParameters and ReceiveParameters Activities
This sample shows the use of <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendParametersContent> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.ReceiveParametersContent> activities. The service exposes one operation that takes a string argument and echoes the input back to the client. The sample shows how to set up the parameters for these messaging activities.

#### Using this sample  
  
1.  Load the project solution in [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)] and build the project.  
  
2.  First run the EchoWorkflowService application generated in [solution base directory]\EchoWorkflowService\bin\debug.  
  
3.  Second, run the EchoWorkflowClient application generated in [solution base directory]\EchoWorkflowClient\bin\debug.
