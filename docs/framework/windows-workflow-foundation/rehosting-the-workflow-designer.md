# Rehosting the Workflow Designer
The [!INCLUDE[wfd1](../../../includes/wfd1-md.md)] can be rehosted in environments outside of Visual Studio 2012 for the purposes of creating, modifying, and monitoring workflows.

 The <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.WorkflowDesigner> type is a wrapper of the canvas, property grid, and other elements, and exposes a basic programming model to handle the majority of designer rehosting scenarios. Hosting the <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.WorkflowDesigner> inside a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) application is a common rehosting scenario for [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../../../includes/wfd2-md.md)].
