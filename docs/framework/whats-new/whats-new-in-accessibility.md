# What's new in accessibility in the .NET Framework

The .NET Framework aims at making applications more accessible for your users. Accessibility features allow an application to provide an appropriate experience for users of Assistive Technology. Starting with the .NET Framework 4.7.1, the .NET Framework includes a large number of accessibility improvements that allow developers to create accessible applications. 

## Accessibility switches

You can configure your app to opt into accessibility features if it targets the .NET Framework 4.7 or an earlier version but is running on the .NET Framework 4.7.1 or later. You can also configure your app to use legacy features (and not take advantage of accessibility features) if it targets the .NET Framework 4.7.1 or later. Each version of the .NET Framework that includes accessibility features has a version-specific accessibility switch, which you add to the [`<AppContextSwitchOverrides>`](~/docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/appcontextswitchoverrides-element.md) element in the [`<runtime>`](~/docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/index.md) section of the application's configuration file. The following are the supported switches:

|Version|Switch|
|---|---|
|.NET Framework 4.7.1|"Switch.UseLegacyAccessibilityFeatures"|
|.NET Framework 4.7.2|"Switch.UseLegacyAccessibilityFeatures.2"|

### Taking advantage of accessibility enhancements

The new accessibility features are enabled by default for applications that target the .NET Framework 4.7.1 or later. In addition, applications that target an earlier version of the .NET Framework but are running on the .NET Framework 4.7.1 or later can opt out of legacy accessibility behaviors (and thereby take advantage of accessibility improvements) by adding switches to the [`<AppContextSwitchOverrides>`](~/docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/appcontextswitchoverrides-element.md) element in the [`<runtime>`](~/docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/index.md) section of the application's configuration file and setting their value to `false`. The following shows how to opt in to accessibility enhancements introduced in the .NET Framework 4.7.1:

```xml
<runtime>
    <!-- AppContextSwitchOverrides value attribute is in the form of 'key1=true|false;key2=true|false  -->
    <AppContextSwitchOverrides value="Switch.UseLegacyAccessibilityFeatures=false" />
</runtime>
```

If you choose to opt in to accessibility features in a later version of the .NET Framework, you must also explicitly opt in to the features from earlier versions of the .NET Framework. Configuring your app to take advantage of accessibility improvements in both the .NET Framework 4.7.1 and 4.7.2 requires the following [`<AppContextSwitchOverrides>`](~/docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/appcontextswitchoverrides-element.md) element:

```xml
<runtime>
    <!-- AppContextSwitchOverrides value attribute is in the form of 'key1=true|false;key2=true|false  -->
    <AppContextSwitchOverrides value="Switch.UseLegacyAccessibilityFeatures=false;Switch.UseLegacyAccessibilityFeatures.2=false" />
</runtime>
```

### Restoring legacy behavior

Applications that target versions of the .NET Framework starting with 4.7.1 can disable accessibility features by adding switches to the [`<AppContextSwitchOverrides>`](~/docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/appcontextswitchoverrides-element.md) element in the [`<runtime>`](~/docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/index.md) section of the application's configuration file and setting their value to `true`. For example, the following configuration opts out of accessibility features introduced in .NET Framework 4.7.2:  

```xml
<runtime>
    <!-- AppContextSwitchOverrides value attribute is in the form of 'key1=true|false;key2=true|false  -->
    <AppContextSwitchOverrides value="Switch.UseLegacyAccessibilityFeatures.2=true" />
</runtime>
```

## What's new in accessibility in the .NET Framework 4.7.2

The .NET Framework 4.7.2 includes new accessibility features in the following areas:

- [Windows Forms](#winforms472)

- [Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)](#wpf472)

<a name="winforms472"></a>
### Windows Forms

**OS-defined colors in High Contrast themes**

Starting with .NET Framework 4.7.2, Windows Forms uses colors defined by the operating system in High Contrast themes. This affects the following controls:

- The drop-down arrow of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripDropDownButton> control.

- The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.RadioButton> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CheckBox> controls with <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ButtonBase.FlatStyle> set to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FlatStyle.Flat?displayProperty=nameWithType> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FlatStyle.Popup?displayProperty=nameWithType>. Previously, selected text and background colors were not contrasting and were hard to read.

- Controls contained within a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> that has its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Enabled> property set to `false`.
 
- The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripButton>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripComboBox>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripDropDownButton> controls, which have an increased luminosity contrast ratio in High Contrast Mode.

- The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewLinkCell.LinkColor> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewLinkCell>.

**Narrator improvements**

Starting with the .NET Framework 4.7.2, Narrator support is enhanced as follows:

- It announces the value of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripMenuItem.ShortcutKeys?displayProperty=nameWithType> property when announcing the text of a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripMenuItem>. 

- It indicates when a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripMenuItem> has its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Enabled> property set to `false`.

- It gives feedback on the state of a check box when the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.CheckBoxes?displayProperty=nameWithType> property is set to `true`.

- Narrator's Scan Mode focus order is consistent with the visual order of the controls on the ClickOnce download dialog window.

**DataGridView improvements**

Starting with the .NET Framework 4.7.2, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control has introduced the following accessibility improvements:

- Rows can be sorted using the keyboard. A user can use the F3 key in order to sort by the current column.

- When the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.SelectionMode?displayProperty=nameWithType> is set to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSelectionMode.FullRowSelect?displayProperty=nameWithType>, the column header changes color to indicate the current column as the user tabs through the cells in the current row.

- The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.AccessibleObject.Parent?displayProperty=nameWithType> property of a  <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewLinkCell.DataGridViewLinkCellAccessibleObject?displayProperty=nameWithType> returns the correct parent control.

**Improved visual cues**

- The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.RadioButton> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CheckBox> controls with an empty <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ButtonBase.Text> property  display a focus indicator when they receive the focus.

**Improved Property Grid Support**

- The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PropertyGrid> control child elements now return a `true` for the  <xref:System.Windows.Automation.ValuePattern.IsReadOnlyProperty> property only when a PropertyGrid element is enabled.

- The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PropertyGrid> control child elements return a `false` for the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement.IsEnabledProperty> property only when a PropertyGrid element can be changed by the user.

**Improved keyboard navigation**

- The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripButton> control allows focus when contained within a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripPanel> that has the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripPanel.TabStop> property set to `true`

<a name="wpf472"></a>
### Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)

**Changes to the CheckBox and RadioButton controls**

In the .NET Framework 4.7.1 and earlier versions, the WPF <xref:System.Windows.Controls.CheckBox?displayProperty=nameWIthType> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.RadioButton?displayProperty=nameWIthType> controls have inconsistent and, in Classic and High Contrast themes,
incorrect focus visuals.  These issues occur in cases where the controls do not have any content set.  This can make the transition between themes confusing and the focus visual hard to see.

In the .NET Framework 4.7.2, these visuals are now more consistent across themes and more easily visible in Classic and High Contrast themes.

**WinForms controls hosted in a WPF application**

For WinForms control hosted in a WPF application in the .NET Framework 4.7.1 and earlier versions, users couldn't tab out of the WinForms layer if the first or last control in that layer is the WPF <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost> control. In the .NET Framework 4.7.2, users are now able to tab out of the WinForms layer.

However, automated applications that rely on focus never escaping the WinForms layer may no longer work as expected.

## What's new in accessibility in the .NET Framework 4.7.1

The .NET Framework 4.7.1 includes new accessibility features in the following areas:

- [Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)](#wpf471)

- [Windows Forms](#winforms471)

- [ASP.NET web controls](#aspnet471)

- [.NET SDK Tools](#tools471)

- [Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) Workflow Designer](#wf471)

<a name="wpf471"></a>
### Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)

**Screen reader improvements**

If accessibility improvements are enabled, the .NET Framework 4.7.1 includes the following enhancements that affect screen readers:

- In the .NET Framework 4.7 and earlier versions, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Expander> controls were announced by screen readers as buttons. Starting with the .NET Framework 4.7.1, they are correctly announced as expandable/collapsible groups.

- In the .NET Framework 4.7 and earlier versions, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGridCell> controls were announced by screen readers as “custom.” Starting with the .NET Framework 4.7.1, they are now correctly announced as data grid cell (localized).
 
- Starting with the .NET Framework 4.7.1, screen readers announce the name of an editable <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ComboBox>.

- In the .NET Framework 4.7 and earlier versions, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.PasswordBox> controls were announced as “no item in view” or had otherwise incorrect behavior. This issue is fixed starting with the .NET Framework 4.7.1.

**UIAutomation LiveRegion support**

Screen readers such as Narrator help people read the UI contents of an application, usually by text-to-speech output of the UI content that has the focus. However, if a UI element changes and does not have the focus, the user may not be notified and may miss important information. Live regions aim at solving this problem. A developer can use them to inform the screen reader or any other UIAutomation client that an important change has been made to a UI element. The screen reader can then decide how and when to inform the user of this change. 

To support live regions, the following APIs have been added to WPF:

- The <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElementIdentifiers.LiveSettingProperty?displayProperty=nameWithType> and <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElementIdentifiers.LiveRegionChangedEvent?displayProperty=nameWithType> fields, which identify the **LiveSetting** property and the **LiveRegionChanged** event. They can be set by using XAML.

- The **AutomationProperties.LiveSetting** attached property, which informs the screen reader of the importance of the UI change to the user.

- The <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationProperties.LiveSettingProperty?displayProperty=nameWithType> property, which identifies the **AutomationProperties.LiveSetting** attached property.
 
- The <xref:System.Windows.Automation.Peers.AutomationPeer.GetLiveSettingCore%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method, which can be overridden to provide a **LiveSetting** value.

- The <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationProperties.GetLiveSetting%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> and <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationProperties.SetLiveSetting%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> methods, which get and set a **LiveSetting** value.
 
- The <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationLiveSetting?displayProperty=nameWithType> enumeration, which defines the following possible **LiveSetting** values:

   - <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationLiveSetting.Off?displayProperty=nameWithType>. The element does not send notifications if the content of the live region has changed.   
   - <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationLiveSetting.Polite?displayProperty=nameWithType>. The element sends non-interruptive notifications if the content of the live region has changed.   

  - <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationLiveSetting.Assertive?displayProperty=nameWithType>. The element sends interruptive notifications if the content of the live region has changed.   

You can create a LiveRegion by setting the **AutomationProperties.LiveSetting** property on the element of interest, as shown in the following example:   

```xaml
<TextBlock Name="myTextBlock" AutomationProperties.LiveSetting="Assertive">announcement</TextBlock>
```

When the data in the live region changes and you need to inform a screen reader, you explicitly raise an event, as shown in the following sample.

```csharp
var peer = FrameworkElementAutomationPeer.FromElement(myTextBlock);

peer.RaiseAutomationEvent(AutomationEvents.LiveRegionChanged);
```
```vb
Dim peer = FrameworkElementAutomationPeer.FromElement(myTextBlock)
peer.RaiseAutomationEvent(AutomationEvents.LiveRegionChanged)

```

**High contrast**

Starting with the .NET Framework 4.7.1, improvements in high contrast have been made to various WPF controls. They are now visible when the <xref:System.Windows.SystemParameters.HighContrast%2A> theme is set. These include:

- <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Expander> control

    The focus visual for the  <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Expander> control is now visible. The keyboard visuals for <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ComboBox>,<xref:System.Windows.Controls.ListBox>, and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.RadioButton> controls are visible as well. For example:

    Before: 
    
    ![Expander control with focus before accessibility improvements](media/expander-before.png)

    After: 

    ![Expander control with focus after accessibility improvements](media/expander-after.png)

- <xref:System.Windows.Controls.CheckBox> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.RadioButton> controls
 
    The text in the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.CheckBox> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.RadioButton> controls is now easier to see when selected in high contrast themes. For example:

    Before: 

    ![High contrast radio button with focus before accessibility improvements](media/radio-button-before.png)
    
    After: 

    ![High contrast radio button with focus after accessibility improvements](media/radio-button-after.png)

- <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ComboBox> control
 
    Starting with the .NET Framework 4.7.1, the border of a disabled <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ComboBox> control is the same color as disabled text. For example:
    
    Before: 

     ![ComboBox disabled border and text before accessibility improvements](media/combo-disabled-before.png)

    After:   

     ![ComboBox disabled border and text after accessibility improvements](media/combo-disabled-after.png)

    In addition, disabled and focused buttons use the correct theme color.

    Before:

    ![Button theme colors before accessibility improvements](media/button-themes-before.png) 
    
    After: 

    ![Button theme colors after accessibility improvements](media/button-themes-after.png) 

    Finally, in the .NET Framework 4.7 and earlier versions, setting a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ComboBox> control’s style to `Toolbar.ComboBoxStyleKey` caused the drop-down arrow to be invisible. This issue is fixed starting with the .NET Framework 4.7.1. For example:

    Before: 

    ![Toolbar.ComboBoxStyleKey before accessibility improvements](media/comboboxstylekey-before.png) 
    
    After: 

    ![Toolbar.ComboBoxStyleKey after accessibility improvements](media/comboboxstylekey-after.png) 

- <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGrid> control

    Starting with the .NET Framework 4.7.1, the sort indicator arrow in <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGrid> controls now uses correct theme colors. For example:

    Before: 

    ![Sort indicator arrow before accessibility improvements](media/sort-indicator-before.png) 
    
    After:   
 
    ![Sort indicator arrow after accessibility improvements](media/sort-indicator-after.png) 
    
    In addition, in the .NET Framework 4.7 and earlier versions, the default link style changed to an incorrect color on mouse over in high contrast modes. This is resolved starting with the .NET Framework 4.7.1. Similarly, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGrid> checkbox columns uses the expected colors for keyboard focus feedback starting with the .NET Framework 4.7.1.

    Before: 

    ![DataGrid default link style before accessibility improvements](media/default-link-style-before.png) 
 
    After:    
  
    ![DataGrid default link style after accessibility improvements](media/default-link-style-after.png)

## Windows Forms accessibility improvements

In the .NET Framework 4.7.1, Windows Forms (WinForms) includes accessibility changes in the following areas.

**Improved display in High Contrast mode**

Starting with the .NET Framework 4.7.1, various WinForms controls offer improved rendering in the HighContrast modes available in the operating system. Windows 10 has changed the values for some high contrast system colors, and Windows Forms is based on the Windows 10 Win32 framework. For the best experience, run on the latest version of Windows and opt in to the latest OS changes by adding an app.manifest file in a test application and un-comment the Windows 10 supported OS  line so that it looks the following:

```xml
<!-- Windows 10 -->
<supportedOS Id=”{8e0f7a12-bfb3-4fe8-b9a5-48fd50a15a9a}” />
```
Some examples of high contrast changes include:

- Checkmarks in <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MenuStrip> items are easier to view.

- When selected, disabled <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MenuStrip> items are easier to view.

- Text in a selected <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control contrasts with the selection color.

- Disabled text is easier to read. For example:

    Before:

    ![Disabled text before accessibility improvements](media/wf-disabled-before.png) 

    After:

    ![Disabled text after accessibility improvements](media/wf-disabled-after.png) 

- High contrast improvements in the Thread Exception Dialog.

**Improved Narrator support**

Windows Forms in the .NET Framework 4.7.1 includes the following accessibility improvements for the Narrator:

- The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MonthCalendar> control can be accessed by the Narrator, as well as by other UI automation tools.

- The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CheckedListBox> control notifies Narrator when an item's check state has changed so the user is notified that they’ve changed the value of a list item.
 
- The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCell> control reports the correct read-only status to Narrator.
 
- Narrator can now read disabled <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripMenuItem> text, whereas previously it would skip over disabled menu items.

**Enhanced support for UIAutomation accessibility patterns**

Starting with the .NET Framework 4.7.1, developers of accessibility technology tools can leverage common API accessibility patterns and properties for several WinForms controls. These accessibility improvements include:

- The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripSplitButton> now support the [expand/collapse pattern](../ui-automation/implementing-the-ui-automation-expandcollapse-control-pattern.md).
 
- The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCheckBoxCell> now supports the [toggle pattern](../ui-automation/implementing-the-ui-automation-toggle-control-pattern.md).
 
- The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripItem> control supports the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement.AutomationElementInformation.Name> property and the [expand/collapse pattern](../ui-automation/implementing-the-ui-automation-expandcollapse-control-pattern.md).

- The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.NumericUpDown> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DomainUpDown> controls support the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement.AutomationElementInformation.Name> property.

**Improved property browser experience**

Starting with the .NET Framework 4.7.1, Windows Forms includes:

- Better keyboard navigation through the various drop-down selection windows.
- A reduction of unnecessary tab stops.
- Better reporting of control types.
- Improved narrator behavior.
 
<a name="aspnet471"></a>
## ASP.NET web controls

Starting with the .NET Framework 4.7.1 and Visual Studio 2017 15.3, ASP.NET improves how ASP.NET web controls work with accessibility technology in Visual Studio. Changes include the following:

- Changes to implement missing UI accessibility patterns in controls, like the **Add Field** dialog in the **Details View** wizard, or the **Configure ListView** dialog of the **ListView** wizard.

- Changes to improve the display in High Contrast mode, like the **Data Pager Fields Editor**.

- Changes to improve the keyboard navigation experiences for controls, like the **Fields** dialog in the **Edit Pager Fields** wizard of the DataPager control, the **Configure ObjectContext** dialog, or the **Configure Data Selection** dialog of the **Configure Data Source** wizard.

<a name="tools471"></a>
## .NET SDK Tools

The [Configuration Editor Tool (SvcConfigEditor.exe)](../wcf/configuration-editor-tool-svcconfigeditor-exe.md) and [Service Trace Viewer Tool (SvcTraceViewer.exe)](../wcf/service-trace-viewer-tool-svctraceviewer-exe.md) have been improved by fixing varied accessibility issues. Most of these were small issues, like a name not being defined or certain UI automation patterns not being implemented correctly. While many users won’t be aware of these incorrect values, customers who use assistive technologies like screen readers will find these SDK tools more accessible. 

These enhancements change some previous behaviors, such as keyboard focus order.

<a name="wf471"></a>
## Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) Workflow Designer

Accessibility changes in the Workflow Designer include the following:

- The tab order changes to left to right and top to bottom in some controls:

  - The initialize correlation window for setting correlation data for the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.InitializeCorrelation> activity.

  - The content definition window for the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Send>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendReply>, and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.ReceiveReply> activities.

- More functions are available via the keyboard:

  - When editing the properties of an activity, property groups can be collapsed by keyboard the first time they are focused.

  - Warning icons are accessible by keyboard.

  - The **More Properties** button in the **Properties** window is accessible by keyboard.

  - Keyboard users can access the header items in the **Arguments** and **Variables** panes of the Workflow Designer.

- Improved visibility of items with focus, such as when:

  - Adding rows to data grids used by the Workflow Designer and activity designers.

  - Tabbing through fields in the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.ReceiveReply> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendReply> activities.

  - Setting default values for variables or arguments

- Screen readers can now correctly recognize:

  - Breakpoints set in the workflow designer.

  - The <xref:System.Activities.Statements.FlowSwitch%601>, <xref:System.Activities.Statements.FlowDecision>, and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationScope> activities.
  - The contents of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive> activity.

  - The Target Type for the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.InvokeMethod> activity.

  - The Exception combo box and the Finally section in the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TryCatch> activity.

  - The Message Type combo box, the splitter in the Add Correlation Initializers window, the Content Definition window, and the CorrelatesOn Definition window in the messaging activities (<xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Send>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendReply>, and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.ReceiveReply>).

  - State machine transitions and transitions destinations.

  - Annotations and connectors on <xref:System.Activities.Statements.FlowDecision> activities.

  - The context (right-click) menus for activities.

  - The property value editors, the Clear Search button, the By Category and Alphabetical sort buttons, and the Expression Editor dialog in the properties grid.

  - The zoom percentage in the Workflow Designer.

  - The separator in <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Parallel> and <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Pick> activities.

  - The <xref:System.Activities.Statements.InvokeDelegate> activity.

  - The Select Types window for dictionary activities (`Microsoft.Activities.AddToDictionary<TKey,TValue>`, `Microsoft.Activities.RemoveFromDictionary<TKey,TValue>`, etc.).

  - The Browse and Select .NET Type window.

  - Breadcrumbs in the Workflow Designer.

- Users who choose High Contrast themes will see many improvements in the visibility of the Workflow Designer and its controls, like better contrast ratios between elements and more noticeable selection boxes used for focus elements.
