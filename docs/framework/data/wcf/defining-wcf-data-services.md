# Defining WCF Data Services

This section describes how to create and configure WCF Data Services to expose data as an [!INCLUDE[ssODataFull](../../../../includes/ssodatafull-md.md)] feed. For more information about the basic steps required to create a data service, see [Exposing Your Data as a Service](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/exposing-your-data-as-a-service-wcf-data-services.md).

## In This Section

 [Configuring the Data Service](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/configuring-the-data-service-wcf-data-services.md)

 Describes the data service configuration options provided by WCF Data Services.

 [Data Services Providers](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/data-services-providers-wcf-data-services.md)

 Describes the provider models for exposing data as a data service.

 [Service Operations](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/service-operations-wcf-data-services.md)

 Describes how to define service operations that expose methods on the server.

 [Feed Customization](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/feed-customization-wcf-data-services.md)

 Describes how to create a mapping between entities in the data model defined by the data service provider and elements in the data feed.

 [Interceptors](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/interceptors-wcf-data-services.md)

 Describes how to define interceptor methods to perform custom business logic on requests to the data service.

 [Developing and Deploying WCF Data Services](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/developing-and-deploying-wcf-data-services.md)

 Describes how to develop and deploy a data service by using Visual Studio.

 [Securing WCF Data Services](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/securing-wcf-data-services.md)

 Describes authentication and authorization for the data service and other security considerations.

 [Hosting the Data Service](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/hosting-the-data-service-wcf-data-services.md)

 Describes how to select a host for your data service.

 [Data Service Versioning](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/data-service-versioning-wcf-data-services.md)

 Describes how to work with different versions of the OData.

 [WCF Data Services Protocol Implementation Details](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/wcf-data-services-protocol-implementation-details.md)
