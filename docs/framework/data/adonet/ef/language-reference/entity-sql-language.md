# Entity SQL Language
Entity SQL is a storage-independent query language that is similar to SQL. Entity SQL allows you to query entity data, either as objects or in a tabular form. You should consider using Entity SQL in the following cases:  
  
-   When a query must be dynamically constructed at runtime. In this case, you should also consider using the query builder methods of <xref:System.Data.Objects.ObjectQuery%601> instead of constructing an Entity SQL query string at runtime.  
  
-   When you want to define a query as part of the model definition. Only Entity SQL is supported in a data model. For more information, see [QueryView Element (MSL)](/ef/ef6/modeling/designer/advanced/edmx/msl-spec#queryview-element-msl)  
  
-   When using EntityClient to return read-only entity data as rowsets using a <xref:System.Data.EntityClient.EntityDataReader>. For more information, see [EntityClient Provider for the Entity Framework](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/entityclient-provider-for-the-entity-framework.md).  
  
-   If you are already an expert in SQL-based query languages, Entity SQL may seem the most natural to you.
