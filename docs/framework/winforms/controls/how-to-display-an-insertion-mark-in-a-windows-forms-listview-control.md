# How to: Display an Insertion Mark in a Windows Forms ListView Control
The insertion mark in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control shows users the point where dragged items will be inserted. When a user drags an item to a point between two other items, the insertion mark shows the item's expected new location.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The insertion mark feature is available only on [!INCLUDE[WinXpFamily](../../../../includes/winxpfamily-md.md)] when your application calls the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Application.EnableVisualStyles%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method. On earlier operating systems, any code relating to the insertion mark has no effect and the insertion mark will not appear. For more information, see <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewInsertionMark>.  
  
 The following image shows an insertion mark:
