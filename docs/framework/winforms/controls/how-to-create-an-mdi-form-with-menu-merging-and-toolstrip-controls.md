# How to: Create an MDI Form with Menu Merging and ToolStrip Controls
The <xref:System.Windows.Forms?displayProperty=nameWithType> namespace supports multiple document interface (MDI) applications, and the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MenuStrip> control supports menu merging. MDI forms can also <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip> controls.  
  
 There is extensive support for this feature in Visual Studio.  
  
 Also see [Walkthrough: Creating an MDI Form with Menu Merging and ToolStrip Controls](walkthrough-creating-an-mdi-form-with-menu-merging-and-toolstrip-controls.md).  
  
## Example  
 The following code example demonstrates how to use <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripPanel> controls with an MDI form. The form also supports menu merging with child menus.
