# Developing a Composite Windows Forms Control
You can develop a composite Windows Forms control by combining other Windows Forms controls. Composite controls that derive from <xref:System.Web.UI.UserControl> are called user controls. The base class, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.UserControl>, provides keyboard routing for the child controls, thus ensuring that child controls can receive focus. For an example of a user control, see the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.UserControl> sample in [How to: Apply Attributes in Windows Forms Controls](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-apply-attributes-in-windows-forms-controls.md).  
  
 The Windows Forms designer in Visual Studio provides rich design-time support for authoring user controls.
