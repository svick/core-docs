# Dialog Boxes in Windows Forms
Dialog boxes are used to interact with the user and retrieve information. In simple terms, a dialog box is a form with its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FormBorderStyle> enumeration property set to `FixedDialog`. You can construct your own custom dialog boxes by using the Windows Forms Designer in Visual Studio. Add controls such as `Label`, `Textbox`, and `Button` to customize dialog boxes to your specific needs. The [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] also includes predefined dialog boxes, such as **File Open** and message boxes, which you can adapt for your own applications. For more information, see [Dialog-Box Controls and Components](../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/dialog-box-controls-and-components-windows-forms.md).
