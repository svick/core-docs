# .NET Framework Client Profile
The .NET Client Profile is a subset of the .NET Framework, which was provided with [!INCLUDE[net_v40_short](../../../includes/net-v40-short-md.md)] and earlier versions and was optimized for client applications. The .NET Framework is a development platform for Windows, Windows Phone and Microsoft Azure and provides a managed app execution environment and the .NET Framework class library. The [!INCLUDE[net_v40_short](../../../includes/net-v40-short-md.md)] and earlier versions provided two deployment options: the full .NET Framework and the Client Profile. The Client Profile enabled faster deployment and smaller app installation packages than the full .NET Framework.  
  
 Starting with the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)], the Client Profile has been discontinued and only the full redistributable package is available. Optimizations provided by the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)], such as smaller download size and faster deployment, have eliminated the need for a separate deployment package. The single redistributable streamlines the installation process and simplifies your app's deployment options.  
  
 However, if you are targeting the .NET Framework 4 or 3.5 and want to learn more about the Client Profile and when to use it, see [.NET Framework Client Profile](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/cc656912%28v=vs.100%29) in the .NET Framework 4 documentation.  
  
 When you install the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)], the .NET Framework 4 Client Profile is updated to the full version of the .NET Framework. For information about installing the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)], see [Install the .NET Framework for developers](../../../docs/framework/install/guide-for-developers.md).
